Learn about renting your property as a film location.

If you feel your house or garden is unique, exciting, or if you feel your house can offer something different, why not look into renting it out, and let your house be the movie star it was born to be.

Would you like to see a famous actor hanging out in your living room. Perhaps you have a home with a unique and special vibe, or does the film industry interest you and youâ€™d like to be a part of it. Renting your home could be a possibility for you to make some extra money.
