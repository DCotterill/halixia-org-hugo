Grow your understanding of Tourette Syndrome (TS).

If you employ or teach someone with TS, learning about it helps to increase understanding, empathy, and support, helping to foster a more accepting and compassionate society for those with Tourette's.

It is estimated that Tourette Syndrome (TS) affects one school child in every hundred and more than 300,000 children and adults in the UK live with the condition. Improving awareness helps to foster understanding, acceptance, and support for individuals affected by TS to help reduce stigma and promote a more inclusive society.
