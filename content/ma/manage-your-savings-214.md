Savings platforms may help you achieve better rates.

You could manage all your savings in one place through a savings platform. As well as convenience you could access consistently competitive rates from multiple banks and building societies.

Savings platforms offer you the opportunity to manage your savings all in one place. Great if you regularly switch accounts to get better rates as you'll only need to register once to access a range of products from financial institutions.
