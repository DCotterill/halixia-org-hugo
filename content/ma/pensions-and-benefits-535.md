Find out how your pensions savings can impact your benefits.

How your pension pot (or your partner’s pension pot) is treated for benefits entitlement depends on whether you or your partner have reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit.

If you’re currently receiving means-tested benefits, and have pensions savings it's important know how your personal pension, especially before taking an income from it, could affect your financial wellbeing.
