Learn about becoming a guide dog puppy raiser.

If you love animals and have plenty of time to give, learn about how you can raise a guide dog puppy, giving these important puppies the best start in life and knowing they will go on to make a big difference in someone's life.

Volunteer puppy raisers receive a pup when they are approximately 8 weeks old and will teach them house manners, provide socialisation experiences, and prepare them for their future career as a guide dog. Creating a rewarding experience for yourself, while helping others. Just remember you will have to give them back!
