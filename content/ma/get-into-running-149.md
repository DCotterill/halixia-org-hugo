Try the 'Couch to 5K', and see if you can get the running bug.

Starting running can seem like a scary prospect, but the NHS Couch to 5K and other tools will help you gradually work up towards running 5km in just 9 weeks, through a guided mix of walking and running.

Running is a great way to improve your overall physical health. It can improve heart and lung health, increase joint strength and stability and improve your mental wellbeing. Running involves very little specialist equipment other than a pair of good running shoes.
