Learn about leaving a charitable gift in your will.

Leave a lasting impact by including charitable giving in your will, supporting causes close to your heart.

Gifting to charity in your will, also known as a charitable bequest, allows you to donate a portion of your estate to charitable organisations after your passing. It can create a meaningful legacy and support causes that matter to you.
