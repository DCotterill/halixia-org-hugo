Investing can be a great way to get your money to grow.

Use these simple guides to help you decide whether you're ready to start your investment journey, when to invest and whether you have a few things still to tick off before exploring your options.

However, if you plan your strategy carefully, you can keep the risk within acceptable levels for you.
