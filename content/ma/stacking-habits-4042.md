Combine routines for better habits.

Improve your daily habits by stacking new ones onto existing routines. Such as standing on one leg while brushing your teeth. Helping to incorporate positive changes into your daily life.

Habit stacking is a powerful way to reinforce new behaviours. By connecting them to established routines, you increase the likelihood of success. In the case of standing on one leg while brushing your teeth, you not only enhance physical balance but also create an easy-to-follow cue for building other habits. This method simplifies habit formation and can lead to a more productive, healthier lifestyle.
