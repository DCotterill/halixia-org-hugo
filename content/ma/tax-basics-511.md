Learn the basics about UK tax and how to deal with HMRC.

We all have a general legal obligation to ensure we're paying the right amount of tax. Understanding the UK tax system will help you to check that you meet your obligations.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is responsible for collecting and administering taxes in the UK. The UK tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year. You pay two types of tax in the UK: Pay as You Earn (PAYE) and National Insurance (NI).
