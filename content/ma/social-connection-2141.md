Help your wellbeing by connecting with community and nature.

Connect with activities, groups, and services in your community to help meet your practical, social and emotional needs to improve health and mental wellbeing.

Nature-based activities such as local walking for health schemes, community gardening and food-growing projects promotes mental and emotional health, reduces loneliness, and enhances a sense of community.
