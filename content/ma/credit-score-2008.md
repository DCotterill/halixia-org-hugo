Learn about your credit score and why you should monitor it.

Learn about what your credit score is and how to track it so it can help you understand your financial health, qualify for better loan terms and make informed money decisions.

Knowing your credit score is important because it provides insight into your financial health, helps you understand how lenders view your creditworthiness, enables you to qualify for better loan terms, assists in financial planning, and allows you to take proactive steps to improve your credit if needed.
