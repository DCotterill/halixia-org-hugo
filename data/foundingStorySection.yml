  ## Our Founding Story

  Co-founders Mark Glover and JoAnne Moore met in 2020 as part of a World Economic Forum and Mercer-sponsored program
  on Redesigning Retirement for the 100-year Life. They quickly established a strong rapport based on their shared
  passion for ensuring broad and equitable access to the tools and resources that can help people live better longer
  lives.

  With extensive careers at global institutions – Mark leading the development of wealth solution strategies and
  technology for millions of banking clients globally and JoAnne in thought leadership, marketing and public policy
  for multinational organizations – they’ve brought together their individual strengths and perspectives to build
  an organization and platform focused on helping all people live the lives they want and deserve.
